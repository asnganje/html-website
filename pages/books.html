                <strong>Web Workers: Multithreaded Programs in JavaScript by Ido Green</strong>
                <img src="../images/favBook1.png" alt="web workers">
                <p>
                    This book is about the significance of efficient Web applications.
                    It outlines that Web apps- would run much better if heavy calculations 
                    could be performed in the background, rather than 
                    compete with the user interface. It discusses how to 
                    use Web Workers to run computationally 
                    intensive JavaScript code in a thread parallel to the UI. 
                    Yes, multi-threaded programing is complicated, 
                    but Web Workers provide a simple API that helps you be 
                    productive without the complex algorithms.
